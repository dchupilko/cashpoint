=Add notes:=

Syntax: *`+ <currency value number>`*

_`<currency>`_ is 3 uppercase letters, any combination is valid

_`<value>`_ is the value of notes. Valid values are 10n and 5*10n, 0<=n<=3 (although some currencies may have larger value notes and some odd values like 2,3,20,25, we do not allow them for simplification).

_`<number>`_ is any positive integer

Semantics: puts notes into cash

Reply: OK if successful, ERROR if validation fails

Example: 

              + USD 100 30

OK

 

=Get cash:=

Syntax: *`- <currency> <amount>`*

_`<currency>`_ as described above,

_`<amount>`_ any positive integer

Reply: one line per each note value, formatted as

_`<value> <number of notes>`_, followed with a line OK

ERROR if the amount is unavailable (cash remains unchanged).

              OK
